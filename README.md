# Simple Calculator

This is a project that I did to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Because I like the design of the iOS Calculator, I was inspired and tried it as a side project.

You have the very basic functionality of the calculator: 

- basic operations
- negative numbers 
- percentage 
- decimals 
- and clean the screen.
